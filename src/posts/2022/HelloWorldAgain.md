<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen I first began my attempt at blogging, one of the reasons behind the project was prove personal credibility. Self promotion via content marketing is a well defined     career hack for developers [^chat] and I was ready to join the legion of misguided devs extolling the benefits of some inane feature of modern JS.

[^chat]: Although Chat GPT is beginning to change the value proposition of writing and sharing articles sadly ... 

The project ultimately failed though. Why? I made the mistake to think credibility only comes from being correct and being correct ALL THE TIME is hard! And a severe constraint on an author as it limits discussion to only safe subjects. If I wanted that, I could just spend more time at work! [^jk] Inevitably I ran out of enthusiasm to write about anything.

[^jk]: JK!  

Well its 2023 and I'm giving blogging another shot. While the need to prove credibility remains a concern, I've come to realize the value of being 'credibly wrong.' Admitting mistakes gracefully is a crucial life skill often overlooked in modern times as lets remember what it means to be hireable:

1. Above average 'chops' ( What I coin 'the Yogi Bear Principle' ) 
2. Don't be an A**hole 

The world doesn't need another intolerable 'genius' so I'll aim for a balance of the two. What does this mean in terms of blogging? It means I'm going to write more about the 'journey' than dictate and moralise about the 'right' way of doing things. I'm hoping the joy of my new found freedom can help keep both of us engaged dear reader.
